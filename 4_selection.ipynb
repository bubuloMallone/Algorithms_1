        "**Purpose of the Algorithm**\n",
        "\n",
        "The **selection problem** asks: Given an unsorted array of $n$ elements and an integer $i$ (with $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ ), find the element that would occupy the $i$-th position if the array were sorted. In other words, the algorithm finds the $i$-th order statistic:\n",
        "\n",
        "- $i=1 \\rightarrow$ minimum element\n",
        "- $i=n \\rightarrow$ maximum element\n",
        "- $i=\\frac{n+1}{2} \\rightarrow$ median (if $n$ is odd)\n",
        "- $i=\\frac{n}{2} \\rightarrow$ median (if $n$ is even by convention)\n",
        "\n",
        "A naive approach would be to sort the array, in $O(n \\log n)$ time and return the $i$-th element. However, this is unnecessary since we do not need the full sorted order, but only one position.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Randomized Selection Algorithm** solves this problem in **expected** linear time, $O(n)$, using a partition-based approach similar to QuickSort, i.e. it uses partitioning around a pivot to recursively reduce the problem size.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Algorithmic Idea**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Choose a pivot element uniformly at random from the array.\n",
        "2. Partition the array into:\n",
        "- Elements \"less than\" the pivot,\n",
        "- The pivot itself,\n",
        "- Elements \"greater than\" the pivot.\n",
        "3. Determine which side to recurse on:\n",
        "- Let $k$ be the number of elements in the \"less than\" partition.\n",
        "- If $i=k+1$, the pivot is the $i$-th order statistic - return it.\n",
        "- If $i \\leq k$, recursively search the $i$-th smallest element in the \"less than\" subarray.\n",
        "- If $i>k+1$, recursively search the ( $i-k-1$ )-th smallest element in the \"greater than\" subarray.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process eliminates about half of the array **on average** with each recursive step, leading to an **expected running time** of $O(n)$.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Complexity Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "Let $T(n)$ denote the expected running time on an array of size $n$.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The partition step takes $O(n)$ time, since every element is compared to the pivot once.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The recursive step is performed only on one side of the partition (unlike QuickSort, which recurses on both sides).\n",
        "\n",
        "The **expected size** of the recursive subproblem is **on average** $n / 2$, since the pivot is random.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hence, the expected recurrence is\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "T(n)=T(n / 2)+O(n),\n",

        "\n",
        "In the worst case (e.g., if the pivot is always the smallest or largest element), one side of the partition has size $n-1$ and the other has size zero :\n",
